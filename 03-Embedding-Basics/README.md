# 02a: Embedding Basics (The "Magic" Part)

This module breaks down how computers understand text using simple, interactive examples.

## 🚀 Get Started
We use a **Jupyter Notebook** to visualize the steps one-by-one.

1.  Make sure you have Jupyter installed (or use VS Code with the Jupyter extension).
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
2.  Open the lesson:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Interactive_Lesson.ipynb
    ```

## What you will learn
1.  **Word -> ID**: Why simple numbers aren't enough.
2.  **Dense Vectors**: How we use "Attributes" (Fruitiness, Dogness, etc.) to capture meaning.
3.  **Similarity Search**: How we mathematically find the closest match.

**Next Step:**
Once you understand the math, go to `../02-hello-vector-world` to see it in action with a real database (Qdrant).
